## Dataset 1: nyc_squirrels 

> **Dataset**:


```r
nyc_squirrels <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-29/nyc_squirrels.csv")
```

> **Ideas:** we could find out the squirals habits like runnig, chasing, eating, e.t.c., and we can also find the specific differences among different specific locations in NYC.  

> **Graph and Table**


```r
dates<-nyc_squirrels %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(num = n())
```

> This table shows the number of squirrels recorded in days in October, 2018

## Dataset 2: Video Games
> *Data:* 
https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-07-30
This dataset seems pretty interesting and straightforward


```r
library(readr)
video_games <- read_csv("~/Desktop/Compsci-final/ideas/video_games.csv")

video_games[video_games==0] <- NA
vg_clean<-video_games %>% 
  drop_na() 
```

> **Ideas:**
find out the popularity/trend of Video games and compare the different video games companies by those variables in the data.

> **Graphs/Tables:**


```r
vg_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price))+
  geom_density() +
  theme_classic()
```

![](ideas_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
top_20_avrplaytime_game <- vg_clean %>% 
  select(game, average_playtime, price, owners) %>% 
  arrange(desc(average_playtime)) %>% 
  head(20)

top_20_avrplaytime_game %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=price, y=average_playtime,label=game, color = owners))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_text(family="STKaiti")+
  theme_classic()
```

![](ideas_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png)<!-- -->

> This graph shows the relation between pices of games, average play times of games, and the number of owners of games with top 20 average playtime
